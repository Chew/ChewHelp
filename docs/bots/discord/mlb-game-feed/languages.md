# Languages

This page showcases what languages the bot supports.
As of now, only English and Spanish will be fully supported, with partial support for other languages.

## Setting a Language

The bot will use the server's language for public responses, and the user's language for ephemeral responses.
There is currently no way to manually override this.

## Supported Languages

The bot currently supports the following languages.

### English

English is the default language of the bot. It is the currently only language that is fully supported.

### Spanish

Currently, command names and descriptions are translated to Spanish.
This is done natively via Discord if your language is set to Spanish.

The following is planned for Spanish support in the 2024 season:

- Translate all responses to Spanish
- Support Spanish in game feeds

## Other Languages

Due to limitations of MLB's game feed, only English and Spanish can be fully supported by the bot.
As a result, there is no priority to support other languages. However, contributions are welcome!
