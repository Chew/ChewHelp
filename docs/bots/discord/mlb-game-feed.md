The MLB Game Feed Bot allows you to view the live play-by-plays for any MLB.com game. This attempts to mimic [gameday](https://mlb.com/gameday).

To get started, add the bot to your server. 
Next, wait for a game to be active and type [`/startgame`](/bots/discord/mlb-game-feed/commands/startgame) to see active Major League games, 
or [`/plangame`](/bots/discord/mlb-game-feed/commands/plangame) to see upcoming games.

Additionally, there are other commands to view stats about games, teams, and more!

## How it Works

You can learn about watching a game feed [here](/bots/discord/mlb-game-feed/watching-a-game-feed). You can see hits, game advisories, and more.

## Commands

You can view the commands for the bot [on the commands page](/bots/discord/mlb-game-feed/commands).
