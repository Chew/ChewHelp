# Context Menus

Chewbotcca has a handful of context menu commands for you to use.

## Message Context Menus

These commands can be ran by right-clicking (or holding) on a message, tapping the "Apps" button, then tapping "Chewbotcca".

Currently, there are three commands:

- [Pastebin File](menus/pastebin.md) - Pastes a file to a pastebin for easier reading. Not needed much on desktop anymore.
- [Unfurl Link](unfurl.md) - Unfurls a link if it's supported.
- [Unsuppress Embeds](menus/unsupress.md) - Unsuppresses bot embeds of a message if they were removed.
