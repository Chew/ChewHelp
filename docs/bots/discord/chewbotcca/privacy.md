# Chewbotcca for Discord Privacy Policy

_Last updated: September 12th, 2020_

Here we will list everything the bot stores, most of the time it's nothing.

## Data Stored Directly

We don't store much data directly, as of now anyway. Currently, we store:

* User ID - Only when [`/profile`](/bots/discord/chewbotcca/commands/profile) or [`/lastfm`](/bots/discord/chewbotcca/commands/lastfm) are ran. 
  This is used to make a bot profile and only stores your User ID by default.
* Last.fm Username - Only when `/profile set lastfm [new username]` is executes.
  This stores your last.fm username and will be referenced when `/lastfm` is executed.
* Server ID - Only when [`/serversettings`](/bots/discord/chewbotcca/commands/serversettings) is run.
  This is used to modify (currently unused) server settings and only stores the server's ID.

## Why are you storing all this?

Depends, do you want to keep typing `/lastfm myreallylongusername` every time? This is designed to help you save time!

## How Data Is Shared?

It's not.

## How can I contact you?

The easiest way is on the Discord server, which you can join by going [here](https://discord.gg/UjxQ3Bh).

## How can I remove my data? I don't trust you.

Run `/profile delete`
