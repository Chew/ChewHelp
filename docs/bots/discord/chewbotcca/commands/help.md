# `/help` Command

Shows some basic information about the bot.
It has links to this website, the [privacy policy](../privacy.md), the support server, an invite link, and a way to run [`/stats`](./stats.md).

Responses will always be ephemeral, meaning only you will see the command response no matter where it is run.

## Example

<HelpCommand />
